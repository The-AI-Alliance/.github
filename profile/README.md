# Welcome to The AI Alliance GitHub Organization

[The AI Alliance](https://aialliance.org) GitHub organization is the place to discover, use, and contribute to a variety of open-source projects for generative AI.

The AI Alliance Community is a non-profit (501(c)(3)) foundation that supports the success of essential open technology and research projects in the AI community with particular focus on data, models, and agents, including their governance and responsible use. We are dedicated to the benefit of AI for _all_ of society - not just industry and not just those who can pay to have a seat at the table. 

We don’t just want to [host your project](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), we want to actively support its development, community growth, and broad adoption! Our unique two-tiered approach of **Core** and **Supported** projects empowers project leaders:

> * **Core Projects** are owned and managed by the AI Alliance. (They are indicated with the <img src="https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/assets/images/favicon-16x16.png" alt="AI Alliance icon"/> icon.)
> * **Supported Projects** are owned and managed by an AI Alliance member organization with collaborators from other member organizations and beyond. 

Both types of projects are committed to transparency and permissive use licensing, and they are open to the community for [new contributors](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), but without inflexible requirements for IP transfer and rule by committee. Learn more about our [project governance](https://thealliance.ai/governance).

The core and supported projects are grouped into the following categories:

          The <a href="https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/open-agent-hub/">Open Agent Hub</a> is a collaborative community of open-source AI projects and domain-specific work groups that seek to make AI Agents successful in the real world through fast experimentation and distillation of learning into usable reference architectures and implementations, and to build out new tools for development and deployment.
        </td>
        <td>
          The Open Data and Model Foundry is building models needed for enabling successful deployment of agents in production across domains and use cases. Good datasets are essential for training and tuning good models and for agent-based applications. The AI Alliance is cataloging permissive data sets and helping to build new ones where needed, where they have clear licenses for open use, backed by unambiguous provenance and governance constraints.
        </td>
        <td>
          In order for the objectives of the <strong>Open Agent Hub</strong> and the <strong>Open Data and Model Foundry</strong> to be achieved, fundamental requirements must be met for safety, governance, and the expertise required to use AI technologies effectively.

## AI Alliance Regional Chapters

The AI Alliance is a global organization. However, localization matters and is key to representation. To ensure effectiveness, relevance, and impact across diverse markets and communities, regional chapters of the AI Alliance exist and more are planned:

* [Japan](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/japan/)
* [Thailand](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/thailand/)
* India - coming soon!
* Paris - coming soon!

## Events
